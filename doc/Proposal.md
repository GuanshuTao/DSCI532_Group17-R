### Motivation and purpose
Our role：Football App Development Department

Target audience: Football fans and sports bettors

Football, or soccer, is one of the world’s most popular sports. Even today, the number of football fans is still rapidly increasing. Before the pandemic, the FIFA World Cup is held once every four years and billions of people would watch World Cup games together. According to reports, there are about 3.5 billion football fans[@topendsports] worldwide and the number is still increasing. Every fan has his/her own favourite football stars and teams so they are always willing to watch their games and follow their clubs. This has laid a great foundation to the sport betting industry. To help football fans and football bettors , we propose to develop a football star app to give them the latest news and information about star rankings. Our app will display various data visualization of the ranking lists for football players, grouped by clubs and countries. In addition, our app will show player values, wages, abilities, potentials and other essential attributes of football players. Users will be able to explore different aspects of football such as football players' geographical distribution by filtering by continent, and customize their own the rankings. 


### Description of the data
Our data set is collected from Kaggle's "FIFA 19 complete player dataset" which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19). The data is scraped from [Sofifa](https://sofifa.com/) and it gives information about 18205 football players from different aspects. We will visualize the top players with their essential attributes, which include their personal information, (`Name`, `Age`, `Nationality`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Body Type`), affiliation  (`Club`, `Loaned From`, `Joined`, `Contract Valid Until`), as well as other important factors such as (`Wage`, `Preferred Foot`, `Injuries`) and so on. In addition, we will also provide advanced statistics about the players’ abilities, such as (`Crossing`, `Finishing`, `Positioning`) and so on. Users can rank by a combination of these attributes and generate customized ratings (‘Overall’, ‘Potential’) which we will summarize and display.

### Research questions and usage scenarios
Timmy is a starting player of the University’s football team. Besides playing league games everyday, Timmy is also a huge fan of sports bets, specifically in football player bets. In fact, Timmy takes sports bets very seriously and considers it a major stream of income. He wants to [explore] a dataset of football players in order to [compare] the different variables that affect a players performance. As Timmy logs onto our FIFA star dashboard, he can see an overall players ranking on the landing page, as well as a list of attributes associated with each player. He wants to [identify] the most relevant attribute that influences a player’s performance. He picks out a number of big-name players and collects their statistics of physical measures, salary, and so on. He then conducts his own statistical analysis on how these variables affect the players’ performances, and hypothesizes that salary and recent game streaks are strong indicators of a player’s performance this season. After thorough research, Timmy will design a new betting strategy based on this analysis, and hopefully he makes profit out of it.
